# Arabic Handwritten Text Recognition

## Overview
This project focuses on recognizing Arabic handwritten characters using deep learning techniques. Arabic script presents unique challenges due to its rich set of characters and variations in handwriting styles. The model employs state-of-the-art machine learning approaches to achieve high accuracy.

## Features
- **Preprocessing Pipeline**: Image normalization, binarization, and noise reduction.
- **Deep Learning Model**: A CNN based architecture for text recognition.
- **Dataset**: Trained on publicly available Arabic handwriting datasets.

## Installation
Clone the repository and install dependencies:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:desire-del/ahr.git
cd ahr
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Modify and test with the ahr_cnn.ipynb:
```bash
cd notebooks/
```

## Dataset
This project uses datasets avalaible in this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mloey1/ahcd1)


Ensure you have the dataset downloaded before training.

## Model Architecture: **CNN**: Extracts visual features from input images.


## Results
The model achieves the following performance:
- **ACCURACY**: 98%


## Future Improvements
- Experiment with transformer-based architectures (e.g., Vision Transformers).
- Augment dataset with synthetic Arabic handwritten text.
